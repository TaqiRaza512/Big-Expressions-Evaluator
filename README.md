# Big Expressions Evaluator

## Introduction
This C++ project features an expressions evaluator using InFixToPostFix Notation, integrated with a Huge Integer class for handling large numeric calculations.

## Features
- Evaluates expressions using InFixToPostFix notation.
- Integrates with Huge Integer class to manage large numbers.
- Demonstrates complex arithmetic operations in C++.

## Technologies
- C++

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/TaqiRaza512/Big-Expressions-Evaluator.git
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.

## Usage
- Use the evaluator to process complex expressions involving large numbers.
- Leverage the Huge Integer class for operations beyond standard data type limits.

## Contributing
Contributions for enhancing the evaluator or integrating additional features are welcome. Fork the repository and submit a pull request.
